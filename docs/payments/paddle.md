# Paddle

If you plan on using Paddle for your payment provider you'll need to set up a few things first. You'll need to create a paddle account and a Boathouse account (this is used for the customer portal, similar to Stripes). Overall Paddle has one of the nicest developer experiences so if you want to add new features in the future, it should be pretty easy.

## Setup

1. Create a new paddle account at https://www.paddle.com/get-started click the 'Sign up' button for Paddle Billing.
